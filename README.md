# HDB Resale Predictor and Comparison to Other Asset Classes

(TLDR: The one feature that affects HDB resale prices the most, is distance to MRT, guess Singaporeans don't like walking)

This 3 person project aimed to study features of HDB resale homes in Singapore to determine how each affect pricing and to create a predictive tool for agents to utilize that predicts competitive selling and buying prices. The HDB asset class was also studied against other general asset classes to determine its performance as an asset.

In the downloadable files, it includes a short clip of the dashboard created and also the presentation that has all the information and conclusions.





## Datasets and How to Use

Full set working files (including dashboard and report): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hluD2vgxDsBZHEy3b1ra0zzKkf9JrSmk?usp=sharing

The main data set is provided in the downloadable files and lists resale prices from 2012-2021. 

To aid in the research and recommendations, here are the alternate sites used:

SORA: https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/statistics/dir/domesticinterestrates.aspx 
HDB RSI: https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_14f63e595975691e7c24a27ae4c07c79/view
Median Income of Singaporeans: https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/IncomeTimeSeries.aspx

## Limitations and Assumptions

Data Bias toward 3 Room Flats: The data we utilized had a much larger proportion of 3 room flat resale prices and features. Hence the predictive model is more accurate for that class of flat.

Restricted Asset Class: Only Singaporeans are allowed to buy resale HDB flats, hence it is not a true available asset class.

No details of more recent years: Dataset ends in 2021 pre covid, more data will need to be studied post covid years in order to make a more accurate prediction.
